            This website was created by a team of 2-6 people over the course of 5 semesters at Otago Polytechnic. I worked on the project for 4 of the semesters in my 2 final years.
            We created this website for a man in Cromwell who files aviation insurance claims for people as he was tired of the slow process of doing everything on paper and also wanted
            to more easily keep track of past claims. He was extremely happy with how the website turned out and it will no doubt help his buiness grow into the furture.

            This website is created with HTML, CSS, PHP, Jquery and started off as a bootstrap template which was modified extensively. One of the regrets we had was not using a framework
            such as django or react, this would have sped up the development alot towards the end and would have made the website easier to maintain and update in the future. Unfortunately
            the website cannot be viewed by the general public as it is protected with a login so only select people can access the site, as that is what he requested due to privacy reasons.
